/*
  [Background Script]

  This is the background script of the extension.
  it provides persistence and handles background events.

  From StackOverflow:

  "A common need for extensions is to have a single long-running
  script to manage some task or state. The background page is an HTML
  page that runs in the extension process. It exists for the lifetime
  of your extension, and only one instance of it at a time is active."
